## Retail Costumer Segmentation Using RFM and K-NN

<b>RFM</b> (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary) is a customer segmentation model that helps businesses identify their most valuable customers by analyzing their transactional behavior. The model is based on three key metrics: Recency, which measures the time since a customer's last purchase; Frequency, which represents the total number of purchases made by a customer; and Monetary, which quantifies the total revenue generated by a customer. By categorizing customers into different segments based on their RFM values, businesses can tailor their marketing and customer engagement strategies to target specific customer groups more effectively.

This approach enables companies to allocate their resources efficiently, improve customer retention, and maximize revenue growth by focusing on high-value customer segments, such as loyal customers and potential loyalists, while also identifying customers who are at risk of churn or require re-engagement efforts.
